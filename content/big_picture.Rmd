### Analyzing the Cost of Saving Endangered Species

## Explore Our Data:

[Populations Interactive Dashboard](/dashboard.html)

## Introduction

The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), first established in 1871 under the name of the “U.S. Fish Commission” is a United States governmental bureau under the Department of the Interior dedicated to “conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.” Though the organization has seen a number of name changes and changes in its official purpose,  the bureau’s current iteration can be most easily understood through the 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA), and its subsequent amendments. In short, the amendments created, first, a standard process which requires federal agencies to consult with the FWS if their actions could harm an ESA listed species, and secondly, provides the FWS resources intended to aid species conservation and recovery. This second objective is what our project examines. Specifically, we explore how expenditures for species conservation impact endangered and threatened species populations.<br><br>
  

In order to attempt to answer this question, our group will be using a number of datasets that contain information related to the FWS’ expenditures, recovery plans, and listing dates for over 1500 endangered and threatened species across the US. The expenditure data we collected spans from 2000 through to the most recently reported year, 2017. These datasets track spending by the FWS, other federal agencies, and State governments. Though the FWS’ expenditure reports show costs related specifically to species recovery as a much smaller subset of the totals stated in our datasets, we have taken the approach that all expenditures related to a species should be considered when determining the efficacy of the bureaus efforts in preservation and restoration.<br><br>

Though the stated goals for the FWS’ work with endangered and threatened species is [achieving recovery and preventing extinction](https://www.fws.gov/info/pocketguide/fundamentals.html), for the vast majority of species being tracked, an increase in population count can be seen as the benchmark variable for evaluating whether expenditures have had a positive impact. While our central focus explores what impact spending has on species recovery, the questions such as, what impacts the spending itself, cannot go ignored. Does spending get allocated based solely on need, with the most threatened species receiving the bulk of funding, or are there other factors that play into these decisions? What external forces might contribute to skewed funding? To provide insight into how some of these questions can be answered, we need to address the aquatic elephant in the room, [fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB6lsbFoYqE).<br><br>

## What Fish Tell Us About Budget Behavior

If you were to [ask a group of people](https://www.aza.org/aza-news-releases/posts/us-americans-greatly-underestimate-how-many-animals-on-the-endangered-species-list-study-shows) how many endangered species were listed in the US, or to name a few of those animals, your typical response would probably be some combination of the [polar bear](https://www.fws.gov/alaska/pages/marine-mammals/polar-bear), the [bald eagle](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/history/index.html) (removed from the ESA list in 2007), or the [humpback whale](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=specialstatus.fedsummary&species=humpbackwhale). What would likely surprise most people is that not only do fish account for nearly 14 percent of all endangered or threatened species, they have accounted for over 61 percent of all expenditures since 2000. Notably, this is not the result of a few outlying years that saw fish receive a massive influx of funding, [as for each year tracked](/dashboard.html), fish have accounted for a minimum of 54 percent of annual spending. This begs the question, why fish?<br><br>

![](../images/main_pages/big_pic/image2.png)<br><br>

The answer is in large part due to section 7 of the [ESA](https://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/esact.html), which as mentioned in the introduction, requires all federal agencies to make special considerations for any projects that might impact endangered species. The byproduct of this stipulation has been massive spending on species that are most likely to be impacted by large federal water projects under the management of agencies like the National Marine Fisheries Service ([NOAA](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species-directory/threatened-endangered?title=&species_category=any&species_status=any&regions=all&items_per_page=all&sort=)) and the Army Corps of Engineers ([USACE](https://tescost.el.erdc.dren.mil/Reports.aspx)). Unsurprisingly, the majority of those species are fish. In fact, of the 20 most funded species in 2017, 19 are fish, and of those 19, 17 received funding from either the NOAA or USACE. One of the most long-ranging examples of these types of projects is NOAA’s involvement with the Northeast Power and Conservation Council in the Columbia River basin, which has been active since 1980. The program routinely spends [hundreds of millions](https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/lwm/aem/projects/salmon_recovery.html#) each year on maintenance and preservation of listed species, primarily salmon and trout. This means that for decades, a small subset of the endangered and threatened species monitored by the FWS has received the lion’s share of federal funding.<br><br>

To put this massive disparity in spending into perspective, from 2000 to 2017, the chinook salmon, rainbow trout, and coho salmon received more funding than *all* non-fish species combined, more than $7 billion. More than half of all species tracked have never received more than 50,000 in funding during any of the years data has been reported. The imbalance in funding is most noticeable when compared against flowering plants. They account for 47 percent of the ESA listed species, yet they only make up 3 percent of total spending in the past 17 years. With everything that’s been discussed so far, you might expect that the data can be split into fish, and everything else. However, expenditure by class is actually stratified into 5 separate groups. Fish receive the bulk of funding at around 60 percent each year; mammals and birds receive between 10 and 16 percent of the yearly total expenditure each; reptiles contribute anywhere from 4 to 8 percent to the yearly total; around 2 to 4 percent of expenditures goes towards flowering plants. The remaining classes receive at most 2 percent of total expenditures in any given year, and typically they receive well below 1 percent. Given our interest in determining if expenditures have driven population growth, we opted to focus on the top 5 animal classes for further analysis. Doing so allows us to focus on the species whose populations have been tracked during our period of focus, while also letting us account for the different levels of spending present between the selected groups of animals: fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.

## A Bird's Eye View

Measuring species’ population trends can be a daunting task. Metrics are seldom similar, let alone simple. In fact, data from the Living Planet Index touts over 1,000 different units of measurement ranging from units as simple as “population estimates” to “the number of arctic hares shot during hunting” to decimals like the number of individuals per 100m2. Attempting to estimate noisy population trends is difficult enough already. Amplified by the random noise inherent in methods such as “number of turtles caught by hand” makes the task even harder.<br><br>

Data sources such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature ([IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org/)) Red List of Threatened Species, an inventory tracking the conservation status of biological species globally, makes analyzing these trends easier. Current population trends are compressed into three categories: increasing, stable, and decreasing. By pairing current population trend data from the IUCN and FWS expenditure reports, a relationship between population trends and expenditures becomes evident. We found that 1% increase in the cumulative expenditures for a species is significantly associated with an expected 9.6% increase in the odds of a population having an increasing or stable population trend. In other words, for increases in overall expenditure, a population is expected to have a higher likelihood of being increasing or stable.<br><br>

![](../images/main_pages/big_pic/image3.png)<br><br>

Interestingly, another significant variable with a positive relationship with increasing or stable populations is the amount of time since a species was listed by the ESA. The earlier a species was listed by the ESA, the more likely it would have a non-negative population trend. For each year since a species’ ESA listing date, there is an expected 2.8% increase in the odds of a population being stable or increasing. Earlier listing dates could permit additional time for research, national attention, and supervision, consequently increasing the likelihood of a stable or increasing population.<br><br>
 
These regression analyses reveal significant relationships between expenditures, time since ESA listing dates, and population trends, but correlation and causation between these variables remains indistinguishable. For all we know, expenditures could be artificially higher for stable or increasing populations to be lauded as success stories and attract future congressional funding. Furthermore, increasing or stable populations could have had funding for longer periods of time and therefore reported a significant relationship with population trends. A hint that this might not be the case is the insignificant interaction between cumulative expenditures and time since ESA listing date. The relationship between cumulative expenditures and population trends is not dependent on how long a species has been listed by the ESA, showing that cumulative expenditures are a strong predictor of increasing or stable populations irrespective of time. With these findings in consideration, in order to better understand the causal effect of expenditures on populations, we must break these trends down by time and by species.<br><br>

## The Chicken or The Egg

Cumulative expenditures are positively correlated with healthy population trends. Logically, it makes sense. More money means more resources and happier populations. How could it be that breaking down trends by time and species reveals a negative relationship between total expenditures in a year and populations. But, our analysis revealed just that. A 1% increase in total expenditures for a population in a given year is associated with an expected .029 decrease in that species’ standardized count. Increases in expenditure are associated with decreases in populations.<br><br>

![](../images/main_pages/big_pic/image4.png)<br><br>
 
“Associated” is the key word as it implies a lack of causality. Reversing our causality assumption, we can see that strong and growing populations receive less expenditure while weak and declining populations receive more. Within the same year, changes in expenditures may be reactionary to changes in population. Decisions in funding allocation may be given based on how well a population is fairing at that current point in time.<br><br>
 
While a significant observation, the reverse in causality and the inverse relationship between expenditures and population do not discredit the findings from our first model. While expenditures may be reacting to population trends in the current year, over a longer period of time, expenditures are still a significant predictor of increasing or stable population trends. Nevertheless, expenditures must have some measurable benefit to populations otherwise we would have a whole lot of questions for federal agencies spending 7 billion dollars on salmon. But to look for these trends, we have to look downstream.<br><br>

## Downstream Payoffs

Like an investment, payoffs are rarely immediate. Funding generates conservation projects, which take time. Conservation projects, such as habitat restoration, encourage species behavior changes, which take time. Changes in species behavior turns to generational growth and repopulation, which takes time. Injections of funding are unlikely to see changes in population trends in even a couple years, let alone the same year.<br><br>

Unsurprisingly, expenditure data alone, when paired with population data, is not predictive when mapping population trends, even when segmented by class. However, when exploring how expenditures have impacted individual species, trends begin to emerge. For about a quarter of the animals, expenditures have a significant impact on populations given a time lag in population. For example, with Chinook salmon, there are no discernible trends between expenditures and population counts 1, 2 or 3 years later. Yet, after 6 years, it appears that expenditures are positively impacting population counts, though with the caveat of a greatly reduced data sample size.<br><br>

![](../images/main_pages/big_pic/image1.png)<br><br>

Inherent among the problems with exploring thousands of varying species of varying classes are differences in lifespan and breeding patterns. The best example of this is the wood stork. Wood storks [begin breeding](https://myfwc.com/research/wildlife/birds/wood-storks/faq/#:~:text=Based%20on%20banded%20and%20known,probably%20nest%20once%20a%20year.) 4 years after they are born, and in the data, the relationship between expenditures and population counts for this species is most significant when accounting for a 4 year time lag. On the other hand, the desert tortoise, which has been the most funded reptile for 15 out of the past 17 years, typically only breed every [12-20](https://www.fws.gov/nevada/desert_tortoise/dt/dt_life.html) years, analysis of which would be greatly limited by the population data available. While the desert tortoise easily has the longest lifespan out of the observed species, with the typical lifespan being between [4](https://www.esf.edu/aec/adks/mammals/redsquirrel.htm#:~:text=Sexual%20maturation%20of%20the%20young,predators%20of%20the%20red%20squirrel.) and [10](https://www.nwf.org/educational-resources/wildlife-guide/mammals/pronghorn#:~:text=The%20fawns%20stay%20with%20their,on%20where%20the%20pronghorn%20lives.) years, the issue of accounting for these lags is fundamental to analyzing impacts of expenditure on population. Accounting for each species’ differing time lags is outside of the scope of our data and our project.

## Conclusion
 
Broken down into its most basic form, the ESA’s intended impact can be stated simply: prevent extinction. By that metric, it has been a wild success, given the ESA has successfully prevented the extinction of [99%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6482936/) of listed species since its inception. The end goal of all expenditures is a species' eventual removal from the ESA list by way of population recovery. Unfortunately, the list of endangered species has grown every year, starting with [75](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/class-of-1967/index.html) in 1967, a number which has ballooned to over 1600 in 2021.<br><br>
 
The road to recovery is a complex one, and no factor is more difficult to reckon with than the issue of time. The Bald Eagle’s removal from the ESA in [2007](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/history/index.html) was a 40 year process, with numerous recovery plans being proposed and adopted during that time period. The Steller Sea Lion has seen a similarly lengthy recovery process, spanning [41 years](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/endangered-species-conservation/delisting-species-under-endangered-species-act). Combined with our analysis that increased expenditures are associated with a higher likelihood of
stable or increasing populations, this highlights the importance of early classification for endangered species.<br><br>
 
Understanding that relationship between expenditures and populations is no easy feat. Our project reveals the ever-moving, cyclical nature between the two variables. Decisions on expenditure allocations may be reactionary to population trends but down the road, populations are impacted by such changes in funding leading to changes in future funding. Identifying the precise influence of expenditure on populations requires far more data on species behaviors and knowledge of the variables that may influence population trends on their own.<br><br>
 
However, the value of being able to accurately model expenditures' impact on species population counts also becomes extremely important. It could provide researchers with a quantitative way to determine if their assumptions about how a population will respond to conservation attempts are valid. The predictions produced by looking at the expenditure reports from 2000-2017 are limited in the sense that we simply do not have enough data when accounting for the population changes lagging behind by several years.<br><br>
 
All that being said, the trends observed do reflect positively on the work being done by the FWS and other agencies. There are always improvements that could be made, specifically the manner in which species are [selected to receive funding](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/222995536.pdf), and the amount of funding provided to the FWS on a [yearly basis](https://www.fws.gov/budget/2021/FY2021-FWS-Budget-Justification.pdf). As the years pass, as more data is collected, and more data is made accessible by college students spending hours converting expenditure reports into readable files, the limitations of the models discussed above will lessen, providing valuable insight into the potential impacts of federal funding on endangered species.
