## Repository Structure

In addition to the pieces provided by the template, the following directories have been configured as described:

* `code` contains loose pieces of code shared between group members.  All code of note to the site and project has been added to pages `content`, however.
* `dataset` contains the data files which are ignored by git.  The files can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o5BlVfD8VJT2DUQfLKJjHZeO-8vIXPcG?usp=sharing).  Note that the `load_and_clean_data.R` file writes cleaned csv files to a directory called `clean` within `dataset`.
* `static` contains the interactive dashboard, the loading and cleaning script, and the following sub-directories (in addition to files generated by `blogdown` and added as part of the template):
  * `images` contains images for each of the pages.  Images for each post are in individual sub-directories within `images`, and images found in the main pages (Data, Big Picture, Analysis, and About) are in `main_pages`.
  * `avatars` contains images associated with the author pages.
